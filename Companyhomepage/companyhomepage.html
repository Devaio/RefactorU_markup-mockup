				We are starting to offer free brewery tours daily from the John Smith Tap Room at 4PM on Monday through Friday and 2PM on Saturday and Sunday. Buy a full beer to take with you and get a commemorative New World Tour Glass to take home for just $2. Tours typically last around 45 minutes.<br>

				No reservation is required - just show up at the Tap Room at least 10 minutes in advance. We have a 30-person capacity per tour with sign up on a first-come first-served basis. We will always do our best to accommodate all of our guests who'd like a tour!
