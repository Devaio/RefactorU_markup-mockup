  		<h3>Bio</h3>
  			<p>
  				Born in 1579 or 1580 in Lincolnshire, England, I eventually made my way to America to help govern the British colony of Jamestown. After allegedly being saved from death by Pocahontas, I established trading agreements with native tribes. With my governing tactics called into question, I returned to England in 1609 and became a staunch advocate of colonization via my published works.
